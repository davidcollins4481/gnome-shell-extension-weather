Installation:
-------------

Copy the tarball to $HOME/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions
and unpack it.  A directory called weather@fpmurphy.com
should be created. 

Restart your GNOME shell (Alt-F2 r is one way) and you should
see an extra button on your panel.

If the extension does not install, check the version number in
metadate.json.  You may have to change it to work with your
particular version of the GNOME Shell. If this does not fix 
the problem, use Looking Glass (Alt-F2 lg) to see what the
error message is.

This extension accesses weather data from World Weather Online
for US zipcodes.

        http://www.worldweatheronline.com/

To use this extension, you must sign up and get a free API key
from World Weather Online.  Sign up is simple and painless.
Once you have the key, you must edit extension.js and add the
API key as the WEATHERDATA_KEY. Example:

   const WEATHERDATA_KEY = '8007f71f8d2a424k112405';

You also need to change the ZIPCODE to the specific USA zipcode
that you want to display the weather for. Example:

   const ZIPCODE = '00802';

This version does not support localized message strings. A
future version will do so.


Version:
--------

V1.0   5/28/2011    Initial released version.

V1.1   6/01/2011    Added support for imperial or metric measurement
                    units. Set MUNITS = 0 for imperial, MUNITS > 0
                    for metric units. 


Notes:
------

This extension is for US zipcodes and displays information in a
mix of SI and US measurements. This was just my personal
preference.  You can easily modify the extension to display the
data in your particular measurement system or for your particular
city and country.  

A future version will probably support city/country as well as 
zipcodes and provide a mechanism for switching between inperial 
and SI units.
